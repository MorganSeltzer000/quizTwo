# quizTwo
## Part One
The code for part one is stored in partOne.go, run "go build partOne.go" to build it, and then run the resulting executable
When running it, include a command-line argument that is a number. This will be the size of the array
## Part Two
The code for part two is stored in partTwo.go, run "go build partTwo.go" to build it, and then run the resulting executable
When running it, include a command-line argument that is a number. This will be the size of the array
## Timing
The code for timing is stored in partTwoTiming.go, run "go build partTwoTiming.go" to build it, and then run the resulting executable
When running it, include a command-line argument that is a number. This will be the size of the array
## Timing Results
This does appear to agree with the theoretical timing, as after running it with args 1000000, 1500000, and 2000000 the time ratio was around 0.58 after the complexity was divided out, indicating that there is just a constant factor and that the time complexity is accurate
